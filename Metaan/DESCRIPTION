Description: The package helps combine estimates from published individual studies and provide 
      a summarized or a pooled estimate of evidence. It makes use of statiscal methods of meta-analysis
      computation such as the fixed effect model and the random effect model. These methods are ready for 
      risk estimates (e.g relative risk (RR), odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR)) meta-analyses but are 
      improved using the alternative method of Richardson et al. for the computation of 
      excess relative risk (ERR) estimates metanalyses.
